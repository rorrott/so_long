# so_long

so_long is a simple 2D game developed as part of the 42 School curriculum.

The goal of the project is to create a small game using the MiniLibX graphics library, handling window rendering, sprites, and player movement.

This project introduces students to graphics programming, event handling, and game loop logic, serving as a foundation for more advanced projects.

## Game Overview

- The player moves a character around a 2D map.

- The objective is to collect all collectibles and then reach the exit.

- The map is loaded from a .ber file.

- The game validates the map and ensures it has a valid path.

## Features

- Map parsing from .ber files

- Player movement with keyboard input

- Collision handling (walls, collectibles, exit)

- Sprites & animations rendered via MiniLibX

- Map validation (rectangular, walls closed, valid path)

## Project Rules (42)

- Written in C

- Uses MiniLibX for rendering and events

- Must include at least one sprite for each element

- Must handle errors gracefully (invalid maps, malloc errors, etc.)

- Must comply with 42 Norminette
